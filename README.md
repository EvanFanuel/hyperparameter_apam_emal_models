**Our Study (Research About Transformer Models for Spam Emails)**
This repository contains the codebase and analytical results for the research project: **"Optimization of Email Spam Detection Using Fine-Tuned Transformer: Analysis the Role of ROC-AUC and Hyperparameter Tuning."**

The study explores the effectiveness of fine-tuned transformer models in accurately classifying emails as spam or ham (non-spam). It compares the performance of **DistilBERT**, **RoBERTa**, and **XLNet** to establish a reliable and transparent framework for spam detection.
